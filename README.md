# kotlin-app for profiles

Build a simple portfolio Kotlin web app that displays the profile image, name, some text with
the experience and a 5 tweet list of the userâ€™s Twitter timeline.
The second part should be a simple API with 3 endpoints: 2 for the profile content, and 1
for the last 5 tweets.

Still in progress...
