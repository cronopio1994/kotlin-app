# kotlin-app for Portfolio

Build a simple portfolio Kotlin web app that displays the profile image, name, some text with
the experience and a 5 tweet list of the userâ€™s Twitter timeline.
The second part should be a simple API with 3 endpoints: 2 for the profile content, and 1
for the last 5 tweets.

### Tech
This repo uses:
- Gradle
- Kotlin with SpringBoot 
- Swagger-ui with OAS 3.0
- Docker , Dockerfile, Docker compose

### How to run:
To run the app backend use the following command:
```./runApp.sh```
The command will do the following tasks:
1. Build the .jar of the application
1. Build the docker image based on the Dockerfile created
1. Run a docker-compose up that contains a local instance of mysql, a flyway container that creates the table needed and the kotlin application itself exposing the 8080 port

### How to use:
Once builded you can access the app via [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) a simple authentication window will pop up, the temporal user is *local*  and the password id *password*
